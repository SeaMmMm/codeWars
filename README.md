> Codewars is a platform that helps you learn, train, and improve your coding skills by solving programming tasks of many types and difficulty levels. You choose how you would like to learn. Do you want to take on increasingly difficult challenges? Maybe you prefer training through repetition and by improving your solutions. After solving a task, compare your answer with other users and learn from them or help less experienced users by answering their questions.

# Solving a Kata

To solve a kata, you need to write a function that returns the expected output. Make sure that your function is named exactly like the kata. If the kata is called "Multiply", name your function "multiply". Also, make sure that your code passes all the tests. The test function is always provided in the kata description.

# Testing with sample tests

Codewars promotes the Test Driven Development approach. This means that you are encouraged to write not only code for your solution, but also add as many tests in Sample Tests panel as you can think of (see [Writing Tests (TODO: add link to explanation how to add more sample tests)] to see how), for various scenarios, inputs, and edge cases. Most kata will have provided you some sample tests to get you going, while others will not, in which case some test documentation will be shown instead. Every time you run sample tests by clicking TEST, the system will execute them against your solution, and tell you if it passed all of them, or maybe failed some. When some sample test fails, you know you need to work on your solution some more. When all sample tests pass, you can either add some more test cases for scenarios not tested yet, or, if you believe your solution is ready, you can go to the next step.

# After Solving a Kata

## Rewards

You worked hard to solve your last challenge, and after you succeeded, you definitely deserve a reward. Each solved tasks rewards you in two ways: progressing your rank, and granting some amount of Honor points. The more difficult kata you solve, the bigger the reward.

## Rank

The rank level reflects your experience and knowledge you have gained by solving kata. You start at the lowest rank of 8 kyÅ«, and each correct solution brings you closer to a higher rank. You can see your rank progress toward the next level on your profile page:
